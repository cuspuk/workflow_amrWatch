  shorten_to_length: 500 # OPT shorten to this length.
  max_n_bases: 3 # OPT Discard reads with more than the specified number of bases. The fifth step.
  max_expected_errors: 3 # OPT - discard reads with more expected errors than this.
  min_length_r1: 35 # OPT, minimum R1 read length. The fourth step.
  min_length_r2: 35 # OPT, minimum R2 read length. The fourth step.
  # cut_from_start: 0 # OPT, removes a specified number of bases from the beginning of the read.
  # cut_from_end: 0 # OPT, removes a specified number of bases from the end of the read.
  quality_cutoff_from_5_end_r1: 20 # OPT cutoff on 5' end of R1 read. The second step.
  quality_cutoff_from_3_end_r1: 20 # OPT cutoff on 3' end of R1 read. The second step.

  adapter_removal:
    do: true # If true, all below options are required. Else, they are ignored/can be deleted.
    action: "trim" # Defines an action to perform with the found adapter.
    overlap: 3 # Minimum number of bases required to overlap with the adapter (default: 3).
    read_location: "anywhere" # Uses adapters defined in adapters_fasta. Searches for adapters anywhere. Possible values: 'regular', 'front' and "anywhere" (default: "anywhere").
    error_rate: 0.1 # Error tolerance used when searching for adapter (default: 0.1).

  read_length: 50 # Distribution will be used from this read length (default: 50).
  classification_level: "G" # The taxa level at which bracken reestimation happens. Allowed: "K", "P", "C", "O", "F", "G" (default: "G").
  threshold: 10 # Minimum number of reads assigned to the taxa level to receive additional reads from higher taxa levels during bracken abundance estimation (default: 10).

assembly__unicycler:
  min_fasta_length: 200 # Shorter contigs than this are removed (default: 100).
  bridging_mode: "normal" # Allowed: "conservative", "normal", "bold". Trade-off between contig length and misassembly rate (default: "normal").
